\description{
MetagenomeSeq is designed to determine features (such as Operational
Taxanomic Unit (OTU), species, genes, etc.) that are differentially abundant
between two or more groups of multiple samples
(https://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/metagenomeSeq). It address the effects of
both normalization and under-sampling of microbial communities on disease
association detection and the testing of feature correlations. For this
function, features consist on the abundance of gene families or metabolic
pathways of multiple samples, obtained using HUMAnN3
(https://huttenhower.sph.harvard.edu/humann).
}
\details{
The function takes a SummarizedExperiment object containing gene/ pathway
abundance values as the assay and metadata as the column data, as well as
several parameter options to run the analysis, using a zero-inflated
Log-Normal mixture model for each feature (\code{fitFeatureModel()}).It converts
the SummarizedExperiment object to a metagenomeSeq object, checks if the
count data is normalized, and if not, calculates the normalization statistics
to apply cumulative sum scaling normalization. It constructs a model matrix,
fits the model to the data and returns the results of the analysis as a data
frame (tibble).
